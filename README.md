# Movie Notebook

## Description
This app lets you easily keep track of which movies your favorite directors and critics like. As you add more of your own movie reviews, favorite directors, and favorite critics, you can see who loves which movies, whether tagged by you or another user--but you'll only see the stuff that's relevant to you. So if you add Greta Gerwig as a favorite director, and later add Quentin Tarantino or critic A.O. Scott, you'll see that they all like His Girl Friday. On any review, you'll see who all liked it, plus any of your own notes or links.
